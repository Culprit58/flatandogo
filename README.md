Flatadango 

Flatadango is a mini web app that demonstrates the three pillars of JavaScript:

Handling Events: Click events for buying tickets, deleting films, and selecting films.

DOM Manipulation: Dynamically rendering film details, updating available tickets, and styling sold-out films.

Communicating with the Server: Using fetch() to perform GET, PATCH, and DELETE operations on a JSON server.


Features

Click a film to view its details (poster, runtime, showtime, description, tickets).

Buy tickets and see available tickets update in real time.

Sold-out films are clearly marked, and buying is disabled.

Delete films from the list and server.
